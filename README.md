## 3. Description: 
This application takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

This application utilizes Node.js command-line, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.

## 4. Installation:
Please make sure to have following programs installed on your computer to use this app:
+ VS Code
+ GitBash
+ Node.js

To generate your own README, `git clone` the repo down to your local. Then, run `npm install` in order to install the `npm` package dependencies as specified in the `./package.json` - `inquirer v8.2.4` and `jest v24.9.0` will be installed. Now, you are ready to go!


## 5. Usage:
When you run `node index.js`, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about the project team; the firt question is about the team manager, then questions about the team members will be prompted. Then, answer the prompts in your command line. Then, team organization HTML file will be generated in `./dist/index.html` - this is the final product of this application.
